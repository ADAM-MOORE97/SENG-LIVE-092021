# Lecture Exercise

For this exercise, the goal is to complete the pizza class by adding some modifications

1. Refactor the initialize method to use keyword arguments. 
2. Refactor the cli so that the Pizza class is responsible for remembering all instances. Remember to use a class variable.
3. Define a class method `.all` that is responsible for reading the class variable `@@all`.
4. Define a `#save` method that will save each new instance to the class array and return the instance.     
4. Define a method `.find` that will accept name as an argument and return a matching pizza instance.
